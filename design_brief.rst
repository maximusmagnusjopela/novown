Timeline
++++++++

Current state of the project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a brand new project with no work accomplished as of
yet.

Vision for the project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Create a sizeable community of lender and renters in montreal. 
For the application launch, there should be a bootstrap pool
of objects to lend in key categories to be determined.

On the week of product launch, success would be to have 
10$ per day of revenue generated.

One month after product launch, success would be to have 
15$ per day of revenue generated.

One year after product launch, success would be to have 
500$ per day of revenue generated.

Roadblocks or gaps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The team has no experience in UX design and no experience
in UI design. The learning curve will therefore be steep
and there will likely be mistakes made along the road to
the produce the sprint deliverables due to that inexperience.

Path from sprint to prototype
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The sprint point the team towards a prototype by constructing
user journey for 2 types of users: the renters and the lenders.
Both of these journey will be included in an interactive prototype for a web 
application.
