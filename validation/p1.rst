Product Idea Summary
---------------------
We sometime need to buy a comsumer product that is only needed 
for a short period of time (e.g: a guitar for weekly music lesson). 
This is inconvenient given the low usage frequency of the consumer product and 
it's high price (say, ~1500$ CAD). The problem is summarized as *needing access 
to consumer products for a short period of time and at a low price*.

Novown is a *microrenting* platform that solves this problem by *connecting
users to a pool of consumer products owned by lenders willing to lease their
property for short periods of time*.
