Product Idea Summary
---------------------
You need to buy a comsumer product, but you only need
it for a short period of time (e.g: a guitar for a weekly music lesson). 
This is inconvenient given the low usage frequency of the product 
relative to it's high price (say, ~1500$ CAD). The problem is summarized as 
*needing access to consumer products for a short period of time and at a low 
price*.

A *microrenting* platform solves this problem by *allowing
users to browse a catalog of consumer products owned by lenders willing to lease
their property for short periods of time*.
