Product Idea Summary
---------------------

Problem
+++++++
You need to buy a product, but you only need
it for a short period of time (e.g: guitar for a weekly music lesson). 
This is inconvenient given the low usage frequency of the product 
relative to it's high price (say, ~1500$ CAD). The problem is summarized as 
*needing access to consumer products for a short period of time and at a low 
price*.

Solution
++++++++
Novown, A *microrenting* platform, solves this problem by *allowing
users to browse a catalog of consumer products owned by lenders willing to lease
their property for short periods of time*.
