People who really need my product
---------------------------------

These are the class of people that are going to really benefit from my product.
The class are enumerated along with a short explanation as to why they really
need this product.

Exchange student/PVTist
+++++++++++++++++++++++
Students that are in montreal for, say, 3 months will be reluctant to acquire
any sort of consumer products since they will be returning home in a few months.
They will therefore really gain value by beeing able to rent these a lot of
consumer product through the application for short periods of time. Here are 
some examples:

1. Jane, a french exchange student,  is able to microrent a guitar once a week
   and keep playing the guitar.

2. Bob, a PVTist, is able to rent a sound system for is arrival party.

3. Jennifer, a PVtist, is able to rent moving straps to move in to is new
   appartment.
